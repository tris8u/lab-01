        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p> Good Afternoon, or Morning, whatever time it is, this is my
      Biography. It started 18 years ago(almost 19 years now) i was born
      on October 1st 2003, in Toronto, Ontario. The elementary school that i ruled
      was St.Andrew's Catholic school, i attended that school from junior kindergarden
      until i graduated in grade 8. Next, i went to a local high school,
      Father Henry Carr is where i graced my presence at, i easily graduated,
      definitely,100% did not fail one course due to me being lazy during lockdown.
      Nevertheless, i graduated, then went on to attend Senca College, but, i don't want
      to talk about that, bad times. 
      Well straying away from that last part, some achievements
      i have done include, geting 2nd, and 3rd in the 2015 and 2017 CML (Canandian Music Leauge)
      playing the piano. To be honest with you, i am horrible compared to alot of people, and i haven't played
      in a while, so i am bad. Other achievements are non-existent, but i have participated in a few track and field 
      events, basketball, and softball tournaments with my schools, sadly, didn't get anywhere
      with those teams, 100% my teammates fault.
      Finally, my goals, i have a couple goals i would like to achieve in my life.
      one of them is being a good coder/programer, why? because i find it extremely interesting.
      Another one of my goals is to travel the world, i've already been to a few different
      countries, some of the are France, Italy, United Kingdom (rip The Queen), Puerto Rico,
      Dominican Republic, and a couple more.
