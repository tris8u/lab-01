        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p> Good Afternoon, or Morning, whatever time it is, this is my
            Biography. It started 18 years ago(almost 19 years now) I was born
            on October 1st 2003, in Toronto, Ontario.</p><br>
        <p>
            The elementary school that<em> <strong>I ruled</strong></em>
            was St.Andrew's Catholic school, I attended that school from junior kindergarden
            until I graduated in grade 8. Next, I went to a local high school,
            Father Henry Carr is where  <em>I <strong>graced my presence</strong> ,</em> I easily graduated,
            definitely, 100% did not fail one course due to me being lazy during lockdown.
            Nevertheless, I graduated, then went on to attend Senca College, but, I don't want
            to talk about that, bad times.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            Well, straying away from that last part, some achievements
            I have done include, geting 2nd, and 3rd in the 2015 and 2017 CML (Canandian Music Leauge)
            playing the piano. To be honest with you, I am horrible compared to alot of people, and I haven't played
            in a while, so I am bad. Other achievements are non-existent, but I have participated in a few track and
            field events, basketball, and softball tournaments with my schools, sadly, didn't get anywhere
            with those teams, 100% my teammates fault.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            Finally, my goals, I have a couple goals I would like to achieve in my life.
            one of them is being a good coder/programer, why? because I find it extremely interesting.
            Another one of my goals is to travel the world, i've already been to a few different
            countries, some of the are France, Italy, United Kingdom (rip The Queen), Puerto Rico,
            Dominican Republic, and a couple more.
